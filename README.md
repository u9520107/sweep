# sweep

Simple tool to clean up files

Usage: sweep folderpath filepattern
  Recursively sweep all files that matchs the filepattern in the specified folder.
  Currenly only support * wildcard, and no path delimiters in filepattern.

This is developed mainly for my personally use to clean garbage files generated by vim or tests, as well as for learning to program in rust.
